== Unreleased

//

== 1.0.0 - 2021-10-12

=== Added
* Parsing empty VEP outputs (thanks @Redmar-van-der-berg).
* Support for Python 3.9.

=== Removed
* Support for Python 3.6.

//

== 1.0.0-alpha1 - 2021-07-02

=== Added
* `--input-linesep` CLI argument for `picard`, `star`, and `vep` for specifying the line
  separator used when parsing the input file. This is also exposed in the `parser`
  functions as `input_linesep`. For `vep` in particular, this is a backwards-incompatible
  change, as the previous behavior is to always parse using the POSIX new line separator.

//

== 0.5.2 - 2020-06-30

=== Fixed
* FusionCatcher v1.20 output without any result rows is now parsed properly (see #11).
* Sections in VEP files containing no data is now parsed properly (see #13).

//

== 0.5.1 - 2020-02-27

=== Changed
* Relaxed Click and YAML requirements. Now crimon requires only minimum
  versions of these dependencies instead of exact ones.
