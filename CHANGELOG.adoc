== Unreleased

//

== 1.1.0

__Release date: 11 April 2022__

=== Added
* Support for parsing STAR-Fusion 1.10 output (thanks @Redmar-van-der-berg).

//

== 1.0.0

__Release date: 12 October 2021__

=== Added
* Parsing empty VEP outputs (thanks @Redmar-van-der-berg).
* Support for Python 3.9.

//

== 1.0.0-alpha1

__Release date: 2 July 2021__

=== Added
* `--input-linesep` CLI argument for `picard`, `star`, and `vep` for specifying the line
  separator used when parsing the input file. This is also exposed in the `parser`
  functions as `input_linesep`. For `vep` in particular, this is a backwards-incompatible
  change, as the previous behavior is to always parse using the POSIX new line separator.

//

== 0.5.2

__Release date: 30 June 2020__

=== Fixed
* FusionCatcher v1.20 output without any result rows is now parsed properly (see #11).
